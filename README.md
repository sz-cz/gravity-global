# Task

The highest level task is based on HTML + TWIG, CSS (SCSS), Bootstrap 4 boilerplate.

Twig template which is rendered to a HTML code is located in `views/pages/index.html`. Bootstrap 4 is partially loaded from the CDN (JS dependencies), and partially compiled out of SCSS package.

All styling related code should be placed within `assets/scss/custom.scss`, this is where Bootstrap SCSS dependencies are located as well. Custom JS should be placed within `assets/js/custom.js`.

Image assets are located in `assets/images` directory.

**Prerequisites**

1. Node.js `10.16.0` is installed locally. [Details](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. PHP `^7.1` is installed locally, PHP built-in server is enabled. [Details](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php).

**Requirements**

- The component is expected to be pixel perfect implementation of the [prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/9981f5d9-8668-4cc6-526f-53b0e436b63e-efb0/). 
- The component should be optimized for all sized devices starting at 320px width. 
- The component should be placed in standard sized container.
- Bootstrap modal should be displayed after click on the button.

**Testing**

Testing procedure for this specific task covers latest version of Chrome with following screen widths: 1280px, 768px, 640px, 320px. You can get extra points for pointing out solutions that won't work in IE11 with suggestions of how to resolve them â€“ no actual work is required to fix issues though.

## Workflow

1. Install all required dependencies - `npm install`
2. Start gulp task - `gulp serve` - to spin up a PHP server and a local environment for development purposes.
